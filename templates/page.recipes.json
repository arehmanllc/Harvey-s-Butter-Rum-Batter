Its popularity grew so quickly that customers began requesting tubs to take home. By the 1960s, demand had grown so much that Harvey partnered with a local dairy to produce the batter in larger batches after hours, distributing it through home delivery routes.<br/><br/>In 1972, Harvey opened his own production plant in Bremerton, expanding distribution and solidifying the brand’s place in the region. Harvey remained passionate about his business and his customers until his passing in 2011 at the age of 94.<br/><br/>Having been born and raised in the same community and deeply connected to its history, I was honored to purchase Harvey’s Butter Rum Batter in December of 2011. Quality, passion, and tradition remain at the heart of our mission as we proudly carry forward the legacy Harvey Hudson began so many years ago.<br/>Our fans are the reason we do what we do, and we sincerely thank you for making this journey so rewarding.</p>"
